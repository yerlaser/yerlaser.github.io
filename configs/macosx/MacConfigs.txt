Mac OS X Keybinding Action Code

This page lists the action codes for creating keybindings on OS X.

[see macOS: Create Custom Keyboard Layout]

Action can be inserting a character, a string, moving the cursor by character, word, line, or page up/down, or open file, create new file, etc.
Text insertion

/* insert a string */
("insertText:", "good morning");

/* insert a Unicode character that has hex code 03B1 */
("insertText:", "\U03B1");

To find the character and the hexadecimal code you want, see: Unicode Search üòÑ .
Cursor movement

    moveUp:
    moveDown:

    moveLeft:
    moveRight:

    moveBackward:
    moveForward:

    moveWordBackward:
    moveWordForward:

    moveWordLeft:
    moveWordRight:

    pageUp:
    pageDown:

    moveToBeginningOfLine:
    moveToEndOfLine:

    moveToBeginningOfParagraph:
    moveToEndOfParagraph:

    moveToBeginningOfDocument:
    moveToEndOfDocument:

Sample code:

{
"\UF729" = "moveToBeginningOfLine:"; /* home key */
"\UF72B" = "moveToEndOfLine:"; /* end key */
}

Move Cursor and Extend Selection

Most (or all) of these actions also have a version with suffix ‚ÄúAndModifySelection‚Äù. For example, there's

    moveUpAndModifySelection:
    moveWordLeftAndModifySelection:
    moveToBeginningOfLineAndModifySelection:

These are the same as moving cursor but also extend the selection.

{
"\UF729" = "moveToBeginningOfLine:";
"\UF72B" = "moveToEndOfLine:";

"$\UF729" = "moveToBeginningOfLineAndModifySelection:";
"$\UF72B" = "moveToEndOfLineAndModifySelection:";
}

For left-to-right languages, there's no difference between ‚ÄúmoveLeft‚Äù and ‚ÄúmoveBackward‚Äù. The ‚ÄúmoveBackward‚Äù is for moving in the backward direction of the language flow.

Whenever there's a ‚ÄúUp‚Äù, there's also a ‚ÄúDown‚Äù version. Similarly, ‚ÄúBackward‚Äù with ‚ÄúForward‚Äù, ‚ÄúBeginning‚Äù and ‚ÄúEnding‚Äù. In the following, these reverse versions omitted.

"~k" = ("insertText:", "()", "moveLeft:");

/* copy all file content */
"~c" = ("selectAll:", "copy:");
