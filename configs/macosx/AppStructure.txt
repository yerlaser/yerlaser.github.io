AppName.app/
   Contents/
      Info.plist
      MacOs/
         AppName-x.y.z.jar
         launcher
      Resources/
         application.icns

So, for WezTerm copy WezTerm.app folder from assets/macos, create folder 'MacOs' and copy 'release' folder contents into it.
There will be two identical Info.plist files but, that's OK.
